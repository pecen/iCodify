# iCodify

A playground for testing different C# coding techniques or solutions. It could be as a Wpf desktop application, a Console app, a Mobile app in Maui, a Web application in Blazor etc. Anything that goes within the frame of .Net.

If you just plan to test a coding technique, the easiest way might just be to use the Console application that is already in the iCodify solution with the name TestConsole.sln. It has already a simple menu system set up, and it's easy to add new functionality to it just for testing specific things that doesn't affect anything else in the app.
